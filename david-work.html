            <h2>Teaching Fellow</h2>
            <h5>UMBC</h5>
            <h5>Fall 2022 - Present</h5>
    
            <p>Every semester since the fall of 2022, I've been a part of the course staff for CMSC 201, UMBC's introductory computer science class, at UMBC. 
                My job there has several responsibilities. First of all, I'm responsible for a 1 hour lab section (consisting of 20 students). In these labs,
                I briefly cover the relevant material and then facilitate an exercise and grade students for their work on the problem. Next, I'm responsible for
                being present 3 hours a week of office hours. Here I help students with assignments, pointing them in the right direction when they don't know how
                to approach a problem or project. The final big responsiblity I have as a teaching fellow is grading most of the assignments of my lab section. This
                includes their homeworks and projects. In addition, I may have some other responsibilities, such as exam proctoring/grading or responding to student emails.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Being a teaching fellow as been very enjoyable and rewarding. The students taking CMSC201 enter the course with varying degrees of experience. Some are already 
                prepared for more advanced courses, others are completely new to programming. As a result I've had to develop my ability to take tricky concepts explain them in an
                easy-to-understand manner. As a result I've gotten a lot better at presenting things in all aspects of life.
