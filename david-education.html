                <h4 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; margin:20px;">Coursework</h4>

                <p>I've taken a variety of courses and gained a variety of skills at UMBC. As of right now (Feb 2024), I have completed 97 credits.</p>

                <p>-Programming Languages used include Python, C++, Java, HTML/CSS/JavaScript (including React and Bootstrap), C, x86 Assembly, Haskell, Forth</p>
                
                <p>-Programming Courses include Data Structures, Assembly Language, Computer Architecture, GUI Programming, Operating Systems, Automata Theory</p>

                <p>-Other notable Courses include Statistics for Engineers, Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Linear Alebra, Chemistry 1, and Chemistry 2</p>

                
                <h4 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; margin:20px; margin-top:40px">My Experience</h4>

                <p>My time as UMBC has been very enjoyable. Every aspect of what I've done has been very enriching. The more relevant part of my experience is, naturally, my computer science
                    courses and projects. Where often I find myself getting fixated on one specific language or framework in my personal "fun coding", both the require and elective courses
                    have ensured that I've been exposed to a variety concepts and languages (my new problem now being trying to figure out how to best maintain all the knowledge Iv'e acquired).
                    Be it user interfaces, data structures, kernel modules, x86 intel assembly (a lot more fun than I thought it would be), and much more. I've also enjoyed the theoretical side
                    of computer science, with automata theory being one of my favorite classes thus far (NP-completeness and turing machines are my favorite topics within the subject). 5 semesters
                    done (plus a summer session) and I have managed to maintain all A's on my computer science courses thus far. My non-computer science classes have been far from useless as well.
                    The stem classes I've taken, statistics in particular have offered tools in my knowledge base that have been utlized in projects that I've been working on.

                <h4 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; margin:20px; margin-top:40px;">Teaching Fellowship</h4>

                <p>Since the fall of 2022, I've been a teaching fellow for CMSC201 (Introduction to Computer Science, taught using Python). As a teaching fellow, I have 
                several responsibilities. First of all, I'm responsibible for hosting a lab session each week. In these lab sessions, I go over the material designated for that 
                week and give the students an exercise and assess their ability and help them as needed. The next major responsibility is hosting office hours. For several hours a 
                week I'm in the designated room helping students with homeworks, projects, labs and general questions on the material. The third major responsibility is grading assignments.
                This is done through automated scripts, manual testing, and code reviewing. In addition, I am also occasionally responsible for exam proctoring, and responding to student
                inquiries via email. Being a teacing fellow has given me valuable skills in making hard concepts easy, communicating, and organizing. There is a great deal of discretion given 
                to teaching fellows, and thus a responsibility to be fair and do one's best at it. Being a teaching fellow also enabled me to attain the Undergraduate CIRTL associate certification,
                a culmination of 2 semesters of learning about teaching, learning, and research methods, and ultimately applying them to a small semester long research project based in my and my
                groupmates lab sections.
