                <div id="myBio">

                    <p>I'm currently a Junior at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. But let's save that stuff for the education section.
                        When I'm not programming, I'm outside stargazing, inside playing the piano, outside with my friends, or inside reading (and yes can I do
                        other things too).
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        My fascination with space has been with me since I was little. Those worlds beyond my own have always been mysteriously, beautiful, and well,
                        otherworldy. Over the past few months I've been rekindling that interest by starting to identify the things I see in the sky. There's, the moon of course,
                        but Jupiter has been shining bright every night for quite a while now. I had to wake up early to see Venus, but it was totally worth it. Saturn wasn't as obvious
                        as the former 2 planets, but once you see it, you won't have any trouble ever seeing it again (unless you're in a very lit area). Mars was around the corner (and by 
                        corner I mean sun) for some time, but now it's starting to get visible, so hopefully I'll be able to catch it in a few weeks. I'm going to have to wait until things get
                        warmer to try and see Mercury however. It's too cold to take a hike at 5:30 in the morning right now.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        When I'm not thinking about space, I'm also preparing my lessons for Sunday. Teaching is fun no matter where it is, whether it be summer camp, UMBC, or Sunday School. I 
                        also play the piano at church sometimes, so I often have to practice the piano for that.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Hopefully as this website develops, you all will be able to better know about me.
                    </p>
