        <h2>What I've Done</h2>

        <p>Over the past few years I've got to program with all kinds of languages and technologies.
            Here are a few of the things I've done, school assignments and personal projects! These aren't all
            of them, and this page is not going to stay the same forever!
        </p>

        <a class = "titleLinks" href="https://github.com/davidpk-cs/simple-bible-for-android"><h3>Simple Bible - A Lightweight Bible App</h3></a>

        <p>The first Android App I finished, SimpleBible is now in closed testing on Google Play! The purpose of this app was to deliver a Bible application
            that is lightweight, add-free, free to use, and fully offline without any quirks (like collecting your email). Despite the variety of Bible apps 
            available on the Play Store, very few can check all 4 of those boxes. I wanted something simple and small, and figured there are other folks who are
            down for an app like that too (turns out there are at least a few!). The app currently supports only the King James Version of the Bible. I do intend
            on bringing other versions of the Bible that are in the public domain to it eventually.
        </p>

        <p>While this app served as a springboard for diving into Android development, I still have a few more plans for it before making a version 1.0 publically
            available. In addition, my goal is to seek after books in the public domain and get them formatted to work with the reader I built for this app.
        </p>

            <p>Here is a look at early development of the Simple Bible App. It's designed to allow verse selection for things like highlighting etc, but I hadn't
                quite made the text very good looking yet then.

        <a class = "titleLinks" href="https://github.com/davidpk-cs/turing-machine-sim"><h3>Turing Machine Simulator</h3></a>

        <p>Every since I took Automata Theory, I was fascinated with turing machines. I liked them so much so, that I built a simple to use turing
            machine simulator. This turing machine simulator has its own language and it shows the cells and head as it moves around.
        </p>

        <p>This turing machine isn't a regular turing machine, but rather a variant, but it's quite close to a pure turing machine.

            <p>If you can write a program to compute something, a turing machine can compute it too. If you CAN'T right a program for something, neither
                can a turing machine.

        <h3>Other Projects I've Done</h3>

        <p>I've racked up more projects over the past few years, and will be dropping more in this page with more details soon. But here's a sneak peak.</p>

        <p>1. React Home Management Web Interface: For a school assignment, I got a chance to use react for the first time by creating a fake but functioning
            home management app. It gave me crucial experience with using APIs and local storage to help me on the more complicated projects I am currently working
            on.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. Memory Verse Challenge Maker: When compiling a list of Bible verses, it can be quite tedious if you need to grab a lot of them. My Python based program
            not only let's you grab all the verses you need without needing to copy and paste them anywhere, it also will automatically put them into a docx file for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            3. Kernel Modules: Thanks to my operating systems class, I was able to get a feel for making some linux kernel modules for simulating a game of blackjack and a 
            magic 8 ball in the kernel space.
        </p>

        <p>
            4. Data Structures: In Data Structures, I had the chance to implement AVL trees, Hash Tables, Priority Queues, and other data structures using C++.
